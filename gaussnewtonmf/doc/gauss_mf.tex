\section{Introduction}
To determines MF's parameters, we solve the following optimization problem.
\begin{equation}
    %\min_{U, V} \quad f(U, V)
    \min_{U,V} \quad \frac{1}{2}\sum_{(m, n) \in R}  (r_{m,n} - \bu_m^T \bv_n)^2+
    \frac{\lambda}{2} (\|U\|^2_F + \|V\|^2_F	)
    \label{eq:MF}
\end{equation}
where
$R$ is is the rating matrix that includes the feedback of the $m$th user on $n$th item at the ($m$, $n$) entry $r_{m n}$. The matrix factorization is technique to find two dense matrices $U \in \bbr^{d \times M}$ and $V \in \bbr^{d \times N}$ such that $r_{m,n} = \bu_m^T\bv_n$, where $\bu_m \in \bbr^d$ and $\bv_n \in \bbr^d$ are respectively the $m$th column of $U$ and the $n$th column of $V$.  In order to show the connection between MF and FM and reuse the former derivation, we apply formulations for \eqref{eq:MF} and have

\begin{equation}
    %\min_{U, V} \quad f(U, V)
    \min_{U,V}  \quad \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}^l  \Bigl(y_i - (U \bw_i)^T (V \bh_i)\Bigr)^2+
    \frac{\lambda}{2} (\|U\|^2_F +\|V\|^2_F	)
    \label{eq:reMF}
\end{equation}
where $l$ is the number of nonzero entries in $R$. We can consider $(y_i, \bw_i, \bh_i)$ as $i$th instance of a regression problem which totally has $l$ instances in the training set.
$y_i=r_{m, n}$ is the value of the corresponding rating from $R$. $\bh_i \in \bbr^N $ and $\bw_i \in \bbr^M$ are the feature vectors. For matrix factorization problem, $\bw_i$ and $\bh_i$  include a single user id and a single item id and are encoded by one-hot, respectively.  
Note that \eqref{eq:reMF} is a variant FM that \citet{MB16a} proposed. 
In comparison with standard FM \citep{SR10c}, 
it is allowed to encode the feature representations in two latent spaces by $U$ and $V$ respectively in our problem. 
\citet{MB16a} mentioned that the function of \eqref{eq:reMF} is a multi-block convex function of $U$ and $V$ so the idea of alternating minimization by using any convex optimization algorithm to solve each sub-problem can be applied. In this work, we focus on solving MF problem. Because it can be regarded as a special case of the variant FM, we mainly study the variant FM in the following.


To solve \eqref{eq:reMF}, \citet{test17a} proposed an alternating Newton method (ANT) which is a variant alternating least squares (ALS) and more efficient than stochastic gradient methods and coordinate descent methods. ANT alternately switches between solving these two sub-problems, namely minimizing over $U$ while keeping $V$ fixed and minimizing over $V$ while keeping $U$ fixed. Note that because \eqref{eq:MF} is a special case of \eqref{eq:reMF}, ANT also can solve \eqref{eq:MF}.
%However, we observe an imbalance problem that one of the sub-problems needs a further number of iterations of conjugate gradient method (CG) than the other sub-problem. That is, it is harder to solve one of the sub-problems than the other sub-problem. We guess that solving these two sub-problems at the same time may get better performance, so we try to apply Gauss-Newton method to solve the problem. 
%In addition, we also try to apply ALS to solve it to observe the extreme case of the imbalance problem.
However, \citet{test17a} showed that test performance of the alternating minimization dose not meet expectation on imbalance data, such as {\tt avazu-app}, {\tt avazu-site} and {\tt criteo}. Therefore, we try to solve these two sub-problems at the same time by applying Gauss-Newton method.

\section{Gauss-Newton method for learning Factorization Machines}
\begin{comment}   The gradient of $f(U, V)$ is
\begin{equation}
    \nabla f(U, V) = \lambda \vectorize(U, V) + \sum_{i=1}^{l}b_i \bj_i
    \label{eq:Grad}
\end{equation}
where $b_i = (\bp_i^T\bq_i-y_i)$.
\begin {equation}
\bj_i = (\bw_i\otimes \bq_i, \bh_i\otimes \bp_i)
\end{equation}
is the Jacobian of $z_i$ and $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the vertical concatenation of two matrices. 
\end{comment}  

The gradient of \eqref{eq:reMF} is
\begin{align}
    \nabla f(U, V) &= \lambda \vectorize(U, V) + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{l} \pdv{\xi_i}{z_i} \bj_i \nonumber\\
    &= \lambda \vectorize(U, V) + \sum_{i=1}^{l}b_i \bj_i
    \label{eq:Grad}
\end{align}
where the loss function $\xi_i = \Bigl(\bp_i^T\bq_i-y_i\Bigr)^2$, $z_i = \bp_i^T\bq_i$, $b_i = (\bp_i^T\bq_i-y_i)$, $\bp_i = U\bw_i$, $\bq_i = V\bh_i$, and
\begin {align}
%\bj_i = (\bw_i\otimes \bq_i, \bh_i\otimes \bp_i)
\bj_i &= \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial z_i}{\partial \vectorize(U)} \\ \frac{\partial z_i}{\partial \vectorize(V)} \end{bmatrix}_{(Md+Nd)\times 1}\nonumber \\
&= \begin{bmatrix} \bw_i\otimes \bq_i \\ \bh_i\otimes \bp_i \end{bmatrix}_{(Md+Nd)\times 1}
\label{eq:Jacob}
\end{align}
is the Jacobian of $z_i$.

We investigate how to compute the gradient of \eqref{eq:reMF} and begin with the following properties of  the Kronecker product among matrices $A$, $B$ and $X$:
\begin{equation}
(B^T \otimes A)\vectorize(X) = \vectorize(AXB)
\label{eq:kronecker_vec}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
(A \otimes B)^T = A^T \otimes B^T
\label{eq:kronecker}
\end{equation}
%By some reformulations 
Then, according to the properties, we have
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \vectorize(U)} &=\lambda \vectorize(U) +  \sum_{i=1}^l b_i (\bw_i\otimes\bq_i)\nonumber \\
&=\lambda \vectorize(U) +  \sum_{i=1}^l \vectorize\left(\bq_i b_i \bw_i^T) \right) \nonumber\\
&=\lambda \vectorize(U) +  \vectorize \Bigl ( Q \bigl(\diag(\bsym{b}) W \bigr)  \Bigr)\label{eq:GradU},
\end{align}
\begin{comment}
    \begin{align}
        \nabla {f}(\vectorize(U, V)) &=\lambda \vectorize(U, V) +  \sum_{i=1}^l (b_i \bj_i)\nonumber\\
        &=\lambda \vectorize(U, V) +  \sum_{i=1}^l (b_i (\bw_i\otimes\bq_i, \bh_i\otimes\bp_i))\nonumber \\
        &=\lambda \vectorize(U, V) +  \sum_{i=1}^l \vectorize\left(b_i (\bq_i \bw_i^T, \bp_i \bh_i^T) \right) \nonumber\\
        &=\lambda \vectorize(U, V) +  \vectorize\Bigl(\sum_{i=1}^l  b_i (\bq_i \bw_i^T,  \bp_i \bh_i^T) \Bigr) \nonumber\\
        &=\lambda \vectorize(U, V) +  \vectorize \Bigl ( Q \bigl(\diag(\bsym{b}) W \bigr) , P \bigl ( \diag(\bsym{b}) H \bigr) \Bigr) \label{eq:GradUV}.
    \end{align}
%where $b_i = (\bp_i^T\bq_i-y_i)$, $\bp_i = U\bw_i$ and $\bq_i = V\bh_i$.
\end{comment}
where $\diag(\bsym{b})$ is a diagonal matrix in which the $i$th diagonal element is $b_i$. Similarly,
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial f}{\partial \vectorize(V)} &=\lambda \vectorize(V) +  \sum_{i=1}^l b_i (\bh_i\otimes\bp_i)\nonumber \\
&=\lambda \vectorize(V) +  \sum_{i=1}^l \vectorize\left(\bp_i b_i \bh_i^T) \right) \nonumber\\
&=\lambda \vectorize(V) +  \vectorize \Bigl ( P \bigl(\diag(\bsym{b}) H \bigr)  \Bigr)\label{eq:GradV},
\end{align}
%The Jacobian $\bj_i$ of $z_i$ is
%To simplify subsequent notations, we define $\bp_i = U\bw_i$ and $\bq_i = V\bh_i$.
%\begin {equation}
%\bj_i = (\bw_i\otimes \bq_i, \bh_i\otimes \bp_i)
%\end{equation}
%is the Jacobian of $z_i$ ,
%where $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the vertical concatenation of two matrices, and $\diag(\bsym{b})$ is a diagonal matrix in which the $i$th diagonal element is $b_i$.
Since $W$ and $H$ is highly sparse matrices, we need to calculate $\diag(\bsym{b})W$ and $\diag(\bsym{b})H$ first.
Then, the main operation for gradient evaluation is a matrix-matrix product that costs $\bbO{2d\times l}$.
\par

The Hessian matrix of \eqref{eq:reMF} is 
\begin{align}    
        \nabla^2 f(U, V) &= \lambda I + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^{l}\bj_i B_i \bj_i^T 
                     + \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=1}^l \pdv{\xi_i}{z_i} (\frac{\partial \bj_i}{\partial U}, \frac{\partial \bj_i}{\partial V})\nonumber \\
        &= \lambda I + \sum_{i=1}^{l}\bj_i\bj_i^T + \sum_{i=1}^l b_i (\frac{\partial \bj_i}{\partial U}, \frac{\partial \bj_i}{\partial V})
    \label{eq:H}    
\end{align}
where I is the identity matrix, $(\cdot,\cdot)$ is the horizontal concatenation of two matrices, and
\begin{equation}
    B_i = \pdv[2]{\xi_i}{z_i} = 2
    \label{eq:B_i}.
\end{equation}

%$\nabla^2_{\theta,\theta} z$

For the standard Newton methods, at the $k$th iteration, we find a direction $\bs_k$ minimizing the following second-order approximation of the function value:
\begin{equation}
    \min_{\bs} \quad \frac{1}{2}\bs^T H_k \bs + \bg_k^T \bs
\label{eq:QP}
\end{equation}
where $H_k = \nabla^2 f(U_k, V_k)$ and $\bg_k = \nabla f(U_k, V_k)$ are the Hessian matrix and the gradient of $f(U_k, V_k)$, respectively.
If $H_k$ is positive definite, then \eqref{eq:QP} is equivalent to solving the following linear system:
\begin{equation}
    H_k\bs = -\bg_k
\label{eq:HLE}
\end{equation}

Unfortunately, the convexity of \eqref{eq:reMF} brings some difficulties in developing a Newton-type FM solver.
The Hessian matrix of \eqref{eq:reMF}  is not alway positive-definite, so a direct application of Newton method may be failed to find a descent direction.
We may consider a positive-definite approximation of the Hessian matrix such as Gauss-Newton method. 
That is, we remove the last term in \eqref{eq:H} and obtain the following positive-definite matrix.
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
    G &= \lambda I + \sum_{i=1}^{l}\bj_i\bj_i^T
    \label{eq:G}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The Gauss-Newton method can be viewed as a modification of Newton method with line search. Instead of solving \eqref{eq:HLE}, we solve the following linear system to find a $\bs_k$ for factorization machines problem
\begin{equation}
	G_k\bs = -\bg_k
\label{eq:GLE}
\end{equation}
where $G_k$ is the Gauss-Newton matrix at $k$th iteration.


In practice, \eqref{eq:GLE} may not need to exactly solved. Therefore, truncated Newton methods have been introduced to approximately solve \eqref{eq:GLE}. Iterative methods such as conjugate gradient method are often used for approximately solving \eqref{eq:GLE}, so at each iteration an inner iterative process is involved.

Another difficulty to solve to solve \eqref{eq:GLE} is that storing the Gauss-Newton matrix if dimension is very large. To overcome the memory issue. Some previous works showed that for linear problems, the conjugate gradient method that mainly requires a sequence of Hessian-vector products can performed without explicitly forming the Hessian matrix:
\begin{equation}
    H\bs = \lambda\bs + X^T(D(X^T\bs))
\label{eq:Hv}
\end{equation}
where $X$ is the data matrix and $\bs$ is the iterate in the CG procedure.

Then, we show that solving \eqref{eq:G} of factorization machine problem can also apply the Hessian-free conjugate gradient method with backtraking line search procedure and the computational complexity per Gauss-Newton iteration is 
\begin{equation*}
(\text{\# of CG iterations + 2}) \times \bbO{2d \times l} + (\text{\# of line search iterations})\times \bbO{l}
\end{equation*}



Next we discuss Hessian-vector products in CG.
From (\ref{eq:G}) and $\bs=\vectorize(S)$,
\begin{align}
    G \bs         &= \lambda \vectorize(S) + \sum_{i=1}^l z_i \bj_i \\
                  &= \lambda \vectorize(S) + \sum_{i=1}^l z_i (\bw_i\otimes \bq_i, \bh_i \otimes \bp_i) \nonumber \\
                  &= \lambda \vectorize(S) + \sum_{i=1}^l \vectorize\left(z_i \bq_i \bw_i^T, z_i \bp_i \bh_i^T\right)  \\
                  &= \lambda \vectorize(S) +  \vectorize \Bigl ( Q \bigl(\diag(\bsym{z}) W \bigr) , P \bigl ( \diag(\bsym{z}) H \bigr) \Bigr) \label{eq:Hv},
\end{align}
where
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
    z_i&= \bj_i^T \vectorize(S)\\
    &=(\bw_i\otimes\bq_i,\bh_i\otimes\bp_i)^T\vectorize(S_u, S_v)\\
    &=\bq_i^T S_u \bw_i + \bp_i^T S_v \bh_i, \text{ }i=1,\dots,l
    \label{eq:DefZi}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
or equivalently
\begin{equation}
    \bz = \pointprod{Q^T}{(WS_u^T)}+\pointprod{P^T}{(HS_v^T)}\bsym{1}_{d\times 1}
    \label{eq:CalcZ}
\end{equation}
We investigate the complexity of the Hessian-vector product. The first term of 
\eqref{eq:Hv} is a standard vector scaling that cost \bbO{(M+N) \times d}.
For the second term in (\ref{eq:Hv}), we separately consider two major steps:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The computation of $WS_u^T$ and $HS_v^T$. $\bbO{d \times l}$
    \item The element-wise product between $P^T$ and $HS_v^T$.  $\bbO{ d \times l}$
    \item The product between dense vector $Q$ and $\diag{(\bsym{z})}W$. $\bbO{d \times l}$
\end{enumerate}
Therefore, the cost of one Hessian-vector  is $\bbO{d \times l}$. After $\bs_k$ is obtained from conjugate gradient method, a backtracking line search is applied to adjust step size $\alpha$, the complexity of the line search is
\begin{equation*}
\bbO{2d \times l} + (\text{\# of line search iterations})\times \bbO{l}.
\end{equation*}

\section{Frequency-aware Regularization}
It's well-known that give frequent user/item more penalties can lead to better testing performance on MF problem. We can replace the regularization term in \eqref{eq:reMF} and get the following new formulation
\begin{equation}
    %\min_{U, V} \quad f(U, V)
    \min_{U,V}  \quad \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i}^l  \Bigl(y_i - (U \bw_i)^T (V \bh_i)\Bigr)^2+
    \frac{\lambda}{2} (\sum^{M}_m |\Omega_{m}| \|\bu_m\|^2 +\sum^{N}_{n} |\Omega_{n}| \|\bv_n\|^2)
    \label{eq:faMF}
\end{equation}

\section{Comparisons with ALS}

\begin{tabular}{r|l}

\end{tabular}
\caption{Complexities of GN, ALS, ANT for MF}
\label{tab:com}
\end{table}

%In this section, we compare Gauss-Newton method with two state-of-the-art methods,  alternating least squares (ALS) and its variant alternating newton (ANT) method on solving MF problem. 
In this section, we compare Gauss-Newton method with ALS and ANT method on solving MF problem. 
We summarize the complexities of three methods in Table \ref{tab:com}. Because ANT uses squared loss here, Newton method only need to solve a quadratic problem in one iteration and do not need backtracking line search.

Problem \eqref{eq:MF} which be a non-convex problem can be separated into independent least squares sub-problems if ALS optimizes one of $U$ and $V$ while the other is fixed \citep{HFY14a-short}. For example, if we fix $V$ and minimize over $U$, the optimal $u_m^*$ can be obtained independently of other rows of $U$ by solving the sub-problem:

\begin{equation}    
    \min_{u_m} \quad \frac{1}{2}\sum_{n \in \Omega_m}  (r_{m,n} - \bu_m^T \bv_n)^2+
    \frac{\lambda}{2} (\|u_m\|^2),
    \label{eq:subMF}
\end{equation}
where $\Omega_m$ is the index set of the observed ratings in the $m$th row, which leads to the closed form solution 

\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
        u_m^* &= (V_{\Omega_m}^{T}V_{\Omega_m}+\lambda I)^{-1}V^{T}r_m,
    \label{eq:closedMF}
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where $V_{\Omega_m}^{T}$ is the sub-matrix with columns $\{\bv_n:n \in \Omega_m\}$, and $r_m^T$ is the $m$th row of $R$ with missing entries ﬁlled by zeros. To compute each $u_m^*$, ALS needs $\bbO {|\Omega_m| d^2}$
time to form the $d \times d$ matrix $V_{\Omega_m}^{T}V_{\Omega_m}$ and additional $\bbO {d^3}$ time to solve the least squares problem. Thus, the time complexity of a full ALS iteration is $\bbO {l \times d^2 + (M+N) \times d^3}$.


We use two common recommendation datasets {\tt movielens10M} and {\tt netflix} in our experiments. We set $k=100$ in following experiments.First, we compare the convergence of ANT, preconditioned-ANT (ANT-P), GN, preconditioned-GN (GN-P), and ALS for solving \eqref{eq:reMF}  at different $\lambda$ in Figure \ref{fig:objvstime}. On the other hand, test performances do matter for recommendation problems, we solve \eqref{eq:faMF} to have comparable test RMSE scores in Figure \ref{fig:freqobjvstime}-\ref{fig:freqrmsevstime}.
% we see that
%GN converges at begin, but slow downs later. ALS suffers from the high cost of $d^3$ if $d$ is large. In order to avoid $d^3$ cost, conjugate gradient is applied in ANT, which leads to a better speed. In addition, preconditioning can greatly boost both GN and ANT.
Figure \ref{fig:freqrmsevstime} shows the results of RMSE versus computation time.

\caption{Distributions of ratings.}
\label{tab:dist}
\end{table}

We try to reproduce bad cases in ANT and ANT-P and then compare how the performance of GN and GN-P is in the situation, so we rebuild imbalance datas from {\tt movielens10m} and {\tt netflix}. There are 1300280 instances those ratings which are less than or equal to 2 and 8000994 instances those ratings which are larger than 2 in training data of {\tt movielens10m} in total. In order to build imbalance data, we change those ratings which are less than or equal to 2 to 1 and change the other ratings to 5 (split 1), 50 (split 2) or 100 (split 3) from original {\tt movielens10m} data. Similarly there are 4544779 instances those ratings which are equal to 1 and 94527333 instances those ratings which are larger than 1 in training data of {\tt netflix}, and we change those ratings which are large than 1 to 5 (split 1), 50 (split 2) or 100 (split 3). The distribution of ratings of these imbalance data shows in Table \ref{tab:dist}.
%The results are shown in Table \ref{tab:RMSEMovieLens}-\ref{tab:RMSENetflix}.

In the experiment, all solvers use frequency-aware regularization and regularization parameter $\lambda$ is 0.05. The experiment results on the imbalance data are shown in Figure \ref{fig:imbalancermseiter}. The training loss of ANT and ANT-P drop faster than GN and GN-P in general, but in the view of validation loss, GN and GN-P both are always better than the other solvers. (In other words, in similar training loss, GN and GN-P can achieve better validation loss than the other solvers.)

On the imbalance data, GN and GN-P both are better than the other solvers, and RMSE of ANT-P is higher than ANT's in the experiment on split 1-3 of {\tt netflix}.

\section{Phenomenon of more number of cg iteration}
In Figure \ref{fig:freqobjvstime}-\ref{fig:freqrmsevstime}, ALS and GN expend more number of cg iteration than other solvers obviously. We guess that the reason is that the condition number couldn't be controlled by regularization parameter $\lambda$ in the frequency-aware method. The following is a simplified example which can show the guess.

\begin{table}[H]

    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Condition numbers of different regularization methods vary with different $\lambda$.}        
    \label{tab:cdnumber}
\end{table}

We randomly build a 10-by-10 positive-semidefinite (PSD) matrix whose condition number is 9484332.73501 and randomly generate 10 frequency in power law distribution : 6, 3, 743603, 368, 1, 157, 1, 29, 51, 80899. Table \ref{tab:cdnumber} shows that the condition number of the PSD matrix varies with regularization parameter $\lambda$. It is clear that when regularization parameter $\lambda$ becomes large the condition number becomes small in global method and preconditioned method but not in frequency-aware method.

We consider a preconditioner $\tilde{M}$ to approximately factorize $\tilde{H}$ such that $\tilde{H}\approx \tilde{M}\tilde{M}^T$, and then use CG to solve
\begin{equation}
    \hat{H} \hat{\bs}  = \hat{\bg},
    \label{eq:PcondSys}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{H}=\tilde{M}^{-1}\tilde{H}\tilde{M}^{-T}$ and $\hat{\bg}=\tilde{M}^{-1}\tilde{\bg}$.

We consider the following diagonal preconditioner for solving \eqref{eq:HLE} as an example.
\begin{equation}
    \tilde{M}=\tilde{M}^T=\diag(\tilde{\bsym{h}}),
    \label{eq:Conder}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation*}
    \tilde{\bsym{h}} = \sqrt{ \tilde{\lambda} \bsym{1}_{d(M+N) \times 1} + \sum_{i=1}^l \pointprod{\bj_i}{\bj_i} }.
